title: "Project 2: Binaural/Stereo"
---

### Project Overview:
In this project, you will create a one-minute piece of binaural music, sound design, or narrative fiction that demonstrates their understanding of binaural and stereo recording techniques. The piece can either stand alone or accompany a visual, but the primary focus is on spatial audio and the use of stereo and binaural methods to create an immersive sound experience.

### Requirements:
**Track 1: Stereo Recording Technique**:  
   - Use one stereo microphone recording technique that we learned in previous classes (e.g., XY, ORTF, or Mid-Side). This will represent one track of your project. 
   
**Track 2: Binaural Recording**:  
   - Use the Zoom H3-VR in binaural mode to record an environment, voice, or sound source. This will represent another track in your project.

**All other tracks: Mono Sources Spatialized with Anaglyph**:  
   - All other sound sources (such as ambient sounds or dialogue) can be recorded in mono and spatialized using the [Anaglyph plugin](http://anaglyph.dalembert.upmc.fr/index.html) for binaural spatialization. For inspiration, you can explore [other projects created with Anaglyph](http://anaglyph.dalembert.upmc.fr/page-gallery.html).

**Panning Automation**:  
   - Integrate at least **two panning automation moves** in your project. One of these should simulate a dynamic panning effect, like a “fly-by” effect (an object moving from one side to the other) or another spatial shift within the binaural field.


### Creative Goals:
- Focus on spatial immersion through the use of stereo and binaural techniques.
- Explore dynamic movement of sound within the stereo and binaural fields to create a vivid auditory experience.
- Practice automation in Reaper to creatively enhance your sound design.

### Submission Instructions:
Submit the following materials to D2L:
 
**Project files and renders**

- Export your project as a one-minute audio or video file.
- Consolidate your Reaper project.

**Written Response**  
   - Write **two paragraphs** addressing the following:
     - Describe the stereo microphone technique you chose (e.g., XY, ORTF, Mid-Side) and the sound source you recorded. Include a picture of your stereo microphone setup.
     - Describe what you recorded with the Zoom H3-VR in binaural mode.
     - Explain the panning automation moves you implemented. How did you achieve the effect you were aiming for?
     - Discuss how you used the Anaglyph plugin for binaural spatialization. What parameters did you adjust, and how did they affect the sound?
     - Reflect on any challenges you encountered during the project and how you overcame them.
     - Provide any additional insights into your creative process, including any interesting decisions or discoveries.
