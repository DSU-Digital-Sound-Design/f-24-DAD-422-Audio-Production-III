title: "Project 3: Ambisonics"
---

## Project Overview

Create an ambisonic music, sound design, or narrative fiction piece that utilizes ambisonic, stereo, and mono recording techniques. The final piece should be at least **one minute** in length and can either accompany a visual component or stand alone.

- **Ambisonic Recording:** Use the **Zoom H3-VR** in Ambisonic mode for one of your recordings.
- **Stereo Recording:** Incorporate one stereo recording technique, such as XY, ORTF, or MS.
- **Mono Sources:** All other sounds can be mono sources. Thoughtfully spatialize these sounds within the ambisonic field, considering aspects such as front-to-back depth, height, and overall immersion.

Include at least **two panning automation moves**. Plan these automation moves in a way that supports the narrative or emotional arc of your piece, rather than using them purely for technical demonstration. Explore the 3D space by considering the depth, height, and rotation aspects unique to ambisonics. These could create a "fly-by" effect or any other dynamic movement that enhances the spatial experience.

Use the **[Ambisonic Toolkit for Reaper](https://www.ambisonictoolkit.net/download/reaper/)** plugins to mix your project. Experiment with different Ambisonic Toolkit plugins to see how each impacts the spatial quality of the mix, and document your findings in the reflection. For more information about how each plugin works, refer to the documentation: [Ambisonic Toolkit Documentation](https://www.ambisonictoolkit.net/documentation/reaper/).

## Project Setup

Remember to encode all of your sources to first order ambisonics B-format. See the documentation for the appropriate plugins for mono, stereo, or ambisonic sources. After encoding, spatialize or pan the source with an ambisonics transform. Finally, send your sources to a track with a decoder plugin that works for your current listening environment, whether it's binaural, stereo UHJ, or the 7.1 studio.
