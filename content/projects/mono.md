<!-- ## Silent Film in Mono

Pick a silent film from the [Archive.org silent film archive](https://archive.org/details/silenthalloffame). Create a sound design for any 30-second clip in the movie you choose. Add enough sound effects to create a feeling of realism. You are limited to **mono-playback**, so imagine simulating a space with only one channel. You could accomplish this using reverb, delay, filtering, or loudness.

Submit a rendered video file to D2L and a paragraph explaining your spatialization process using the project's limitations.

## Objective
Create a 1-2 minute audio-only piece that simulates a walk through a specific environment using only mono sound sources. The challenge is to create a sense of depth, movement, and spatial awareness using mono processing techniques.

## Requirements
1. Choose a specific environment for your sound walk (e.g., forest, city street, beach, spacecraft, fantasy realm).
2. Use only mono sound sources and processing techniques.
3. Employ various audio processing methods to create a sense of space and movement:
   - Reverb (to simulate different spaces)
   - Delay (to create depth and echo effects)
   - Filtering (to mimic occlusion and distance)
   - Volume/loudness (to indicate proximity and movement)
4. Include at least 10 distinct sound elements in your composition.
5. Create a clear sense of movement or journey through your chosen environment.

## Technical Constraints
- All audio must be in mono format.
- Final output should be a single mono audio file.
- Sample rate: 44kHz
- Bit depth: 24-bit

## Creative Guidelines
- Think about how sounds change as you move closer to or farther from their source.
- Consider how different spaces might affect the sound (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor, small room vs. large hall).
- Use creative processing to suggest height, depth, and width within the mono constraints.
- Think about the narrative of your sound walk. What story does it tell?

## Submission Requirements
1. A mono audio file of your 1-2 minute sound walk (.wav format)
2. A written document (250 words) explaining:
   - Your chosen environment and the narrative of your sound walk
   - At least three specific techniques you used to create a sense of space and movement
   - The challenges you faced working in mono and how you overcame them

## Examples for Study

While these examples are in stereo, they demonstrate techniques and approaches that can be adapted for mono work:

### Luc Ferrari - "Presque Rien No. 1" (1970)
   - A day at a Yugoslavian fishing village captured with minimal processing.
   - Notice how layering and volume changes create depth and suggest movement.
   - Consider how you might achieve similar effects within mono constraints.
### Hildegard Westerkamp - "Kits Beach Soundwalk" (1989)
   - Listen for how Westerkamp uses filtering to highlight different elements of the soundscape.
   - Notice how she creates a sense of moving closer to or farther from sound sources.
   - Pay attention to the use of volume and equalization to suggest different spaces and distances.

### As you listen, consider:
- How do these artists create a sense of space and movement?
- What techniques could you adapt for your mono sound walk?
- How might you recreate some of the stereo effects in mono?

### Additional Mono Resources:
- Early radio drama productions
- Selected works by Chris Watson and Bernie Krause
- Historical field recordings from ethnomusicologists

Remember, your goal is not to replicate these works, but to draw inspiration and techniques that you can apply creatively to your own unique mono sound walk.
