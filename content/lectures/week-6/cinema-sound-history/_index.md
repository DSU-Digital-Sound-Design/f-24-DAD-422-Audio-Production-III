> It was at the 1987 October SMPTE meeting. People were saying, “How many channels should there be [in the digital sound standard for cinema]?” And people said two . . . people said four . . . one said eight. And I put my hand up and said, “five point one.” Everybody went, “What is he talking about?”

Here is a bullet point summary of the early development of multi-channel sound in cinema, based on the information you provided:

* **1879:** Alexander Graham Bell experiments with two-channel sound over telephones.
* **1927:** First multi-track recordings for cinema, used in the film _The Jazz Singer_.
* **1928:** Bell Labs records an orchestra onto a disk using two separate tracks, splitting the signal from one microphone to improve sound quality.
* **1932:** Bell Labs makes another two-track recording, this time using two distinct audio channels, creating the first known true "stereo" recording.
* **1933:** Bell Labs researchers conclude that a three-channel frontal sound system is a practical approach to representing an infinite number of front loudspeaker channels.
* **1937:** Bell Labs presents the first documented presentation of multi-channel audio synched to film, using three frontal channels to create three different sound effects.
* **1940:** Fantasia is released, using three speakers behind the screen and a surround channel with ninety-six speakers around and behind the audience to create a more immersive and realistic soundstage.

{{% note %}}
* **The film's multi-channel mix was a hybrid of two approaches**:
  * **"Correct" spatial reproduction of the orchestral recordings**:
    * This approach aimed for realism and fidelity to the original orchestral performance. The sound engineers positioned the recorded sounds in the theater to match the locations of the instruments in the orchestra, creating an authentic soundstage. 
    * Binaural recording techniques, along with precise placement of speakers (Left, Center, Right channels), helped accurately reproduce the spatial relationship between different sections of the orchestra (strings, woodwinds, brass, etc.), making the audience feel as though they were in the concert hall with the musicians.
  * **"Spectacular" approach**:
    * This approach broke free from the traditional orchestral arrangement. The engineers experimented by moving sound elements around the theater to heighten the emotional impact of the scenes. For example, sound effects and musical motifs were moved dynamically to follow action across the screen, helping to draw the audience deeper into the film.
    * In certain scenes, sounds would swirl around the audience or travel across the speakers to amplify dramatic tension, such as during storm scenes or in scenes featuring dancing animals
* **Fantasound's innovative technical design**:
  * The film was encoded on 35mm film with four tracks:
    * Three channels for **Left, Center, and Right** speakers positioned behind the screen to create directional sound, giving depth and focus to dialogue and music.
    * A fourth control track was used to synchronize two projectors, ensuring perfect alignment of the sound and image for each performance.
* **Impact on cinema**:
  * Fantasound was groundbreaking for its time, introducing cinema audiences to a multi-channel, immersive sound experience. It laid the groundwork for the development of surround sound in films, though it was expensive and complex to implement widely at the time. The blending of "correct" and "spectacular" approaches in *Fantasia* paved the way for future filmmakers to think creatively about sound design, balancing realism with artistic manipulation for emotional and narrative impact.

**Question:** How do the 'correct' and 'spectacular' approaches in Fantasound reflect different priorities in sound design? Can you think of modern films that balance realism with artistic manipulation of sound to enhance the audience's experience?

### The problem of Dolby Stereo

<img src="superman.png" width="75%">

{{% note %}}
- Dolby Stereo's introduction marked a significant shift from monophonic optical sound in theaters, offering improved dynamic and frequency ranges, as well as cleaner sound quality.
- The 1980s saw further enhancements with Dolby SR (Spectral Recording), incorporating advanced noise reduction techniques into the Dolby Stereo matrix.
- While not flawless, Dolby Stereo became a successful industry standard.

**Notable Films that Circumvented the Standard**

- Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)
- Superman (1978)
- Apocalypse Now (1979)
- Stanley Kubrick opted for mono sound in his films due to unpredictable playback issues with matrixed sound during Dolby Stereo's dominance era. He chose to continue making his films in mono throughout this period.

**Question for students:**
Despite Dolby Stereo's widespread adoption, some prominent filmmakers chose not to use it. What factors might influence a director's decision to use or avoid new audio technologies? How might these choices impact the audience's experience of a film?

> [Quad can] create the illusion of a sound moving in all four quadrants of the room. Mono surround, 35mm Dolby optical, pretty much ties you to the idea of some mixture of front and back. Since quadraphonics gives you a left back and a right back, you can steer that sound through 360 degrees.

#### Dolby Stereo and the Emergence of a New Aesthetic

> "The 'emergence' of a new sound aesthetic in the use of [Dolby Stereo] ambience hides the fact that no other aesthetic could possibly have emerged simply because of the system’s design. The screen centrality and the lack of divergence inherent in Dolby Stereo ensured that all dialogue and main sound effects would be channeled to the screen speakers and not the surrounds."
>
> — Jay Beck

{{% note %}}
- The introduction of the surround channel in cinema sound systems allowed for the placement of sounds around the audience.
- However, Dolby Stereo reinforced traditional norms of monophonic, screen-centric cinema instead of fully exploring true surround sound.
- Dolby's multi-channel sound design was rooted in monophonic principles, which limited the creative possibilities of surround sound.
- The technical constraints of the Dolby Stereo matrix, more than filmmakers' preferences, shaped sound design practices from the 1980s through the early 1990s.

## SMPTE Digital Sound Standard (1987)

1. any digital multi-channel system should use fully discrete channels rather than matrix encoding to avoid encountering Dolby Stereo’s problems with sounds not playing back in the correct channels.
2. the new digital system should have at least CD-quality sound so that cinematic systems could catch up with home audio.

[ITU-R BS.775-1](https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.775-1-199407-S!!PDF-E.pdf)

{{% note %}}
**Development of 5.1 surround sound**

* In the late 1980s, SMPTE began to work on a digital sound standard for film with two objectives in mind:
    * Fully discrete channels rather than matrix encoding
    * CD-quality sound
* The number of channels required for the new standard was a matter of debate.
* Tom Holman, a sound designer and engineer, proposed a 5.1-channel configuration.
* The `.1` refers to the low-frequency effects (LFE) channel, which has a narrower frequency range than the other channels.

**Advantages of 5.1 surround sound over Dolby Stereo**

* **Fully discrete channels:** This means that each channel is independent of the others, which allows for more precise sound placement and mixing.
* **CD-quality sound:** 5.1 surround sound offers a wider frequency response and higher dynamic range than Dolby Stereo, resulting in a more realistic and immersive soundstage.

**Why 5.1 surround sound became the standard**

* 5.1 surround sound offered a significant improvement in sound quality over Dolby Stereo.
* It was also a practical solution, as it could be implemented using existing theater infrastructure.
* Additionally, 5.1 surround sound was compatible with home theater systems, which was becoming increasingly popular at the time.

### LFE Channel

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hm4XMF1apD4?si=vLqD8XF8IaAkN-LZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}
**Why a dedicated LFE channel is important in 5.1 surround sound**

* **To provide the same range of volumes to low-frequency sounds as they do to higher-frequency ones.**
* **To create an enveloping bass sound and to give added emphasis to localized sounds coming from any of the full-range channels.**

Low-frequency sounds require more energy to produce and are more difficult to localize than higher-frequency sounds. By dedicating an entire channel to low frequencies, 5.1 surround sound systems can provide a more realistic and immersive listening experience.

Here are some examples of how the LFE channel is used in films:

* In the explosion scene in the film Independence Day, the LFE channel is used to reproduce the deep rumble of the alien spaceships.
* In the film Titanic, the LFE channel is used to reproduce the deep creaking and groaning of the ship as it breaks in half.
* In the film Jurassic Park, the LFE channel is used to reproduce the deep roar of the dinosaurs.

- Criteria for success of a new standard
  - it would have to be as robust and manageable as the system it replaced.
  - it would have to be backward compatible with existing analog sound systems.
  - it would have to be cost effective

{{% note %}}
This last criterion was particularly critical: a major reason Dolby Stereo was so successful despite its matrix encoding scheme was that it had no economically viable competition, as no one had been able to devise a non-matrixed method for fitting more than two channels onto 35mm film without using (expensive) magnetic striping.

### Cinema Digital Sound (CDS)

![](cdsadsm.jpg)

{{% note %}}
**Failure of Cinema Digital Sound (CDS)**

* **CDS was the first digital sound system to be used on a major release**, with the 1990 film Dick Tracy.
* **CDS failed to meet the three practical requirements for a successful digital surround sound system:**
    * **It was not affordable.** CDS equipment was much more expensive than Dolby's equipment.
    * **It was not compatible with existing theater infrastructure.** Theaters would have to purchase new equipment to use CDS.
    * **It was not reliable.** The CDS processor used to decode the soundtrack overheated and started a fire in the projection room at the Hollywood premiere of Days of Thunder.

As a result of these failures, CDS was not widely adopted by the film industry.

**Lessons learned from the failure of CDS**

* **Affordability, compatibility, and reliability are essential for the success of any new technology.**
* **It is important to test new technologies thoroughly before releasing them to the public.**

### Digital Sound arrives in Triplicate

* Dolby SR-D (Spectral Recording - Digital), DTS  (Digital Theater Systems):, and SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound)
  *  **They were affordable.** Dolby SR-D, DTS, and SDDS were all less expensive than CDS.
  * **They were compatible with existing theater infrastructure.** Theaters could use their existing Dolby Stereo equipment to play back digital soundtracks.
  * **They were reliable.** Dolby SR-D, DTS, and SDDS had fewer reliability problems than CDS.


{{% note %}}
**Success of Dolby SR-D, DTS, and SDDS**

* **These systems were successful in large part because they met the three practical requirements for a successful digital surround sound system:**
    * **They were affordable.** Dolby SR-D, DTS, and SDDS were all less expensive than CDS.
    * **They were compatible with existing theater infrastructure.** Theaters could use their existing Dolby Stereo equipment to play back digital soundtracks.
    * **They were reliable.** Dolby SR-D, DTS, and SDDS had fewer reliability problems than CDS.

**Robustness, backward compatibility, and economic viability**

* **Robustness:** Dolby SR-D, DTS, and SDDS were all designed to be robust systems. In the event of a problem with the digital soundtrack, playback would simply revert to the Dolby Stereo track. This ensured that audiences would always be able to hear the sound of the film.
* **Backward compatibility:** Dolby SR-D, DTS, and SDDS were all backward compatible with Dolby Stereo. This meant that theaters did not have to maintain dual print inventories.
* **Economic viability:** Dolby SR-D, DTS, and SDDS were all economically viable systems. They were affordable to purchase and maintain.

### Dolby SR-D (1992)

![](batman-returns-1992-movie-big-2-123movies-3902521124.jpg)

{{% note %}}
**Why Dolby SR-D was not as successful as DTS or SDDS**

* **High cost:** Retrofitting an existing theater with SR-D cost around $20,000 at the time.
* **Backward compatibility:** SR-D-encoded prints were backward compatible with analog systems, so most theaters chose to use the Dolby Stereo soundtrack rather than pay for the new system.
* **Lack of awareness:** The public was not aware of the new sound system. Even the ads for Batman Returns mentioned nothing about SR-D.

In contrast, DTS and SDDS were more affordable and easier to retrofit into existing theaters. They were also marketed more effectively. As a result, DTS and SDDS became the more popular digital surround sound systems in cinemas.

**Additional factors that may have contributed to the failure of Dolby SR-D:**

* **Competition from DTS and SDDS:** DTS and SDDS were also vying for market share, and they were both more aggressive in their marketing and sales efforts.
* **Lack of support from Hollywood studios:** The major Hollywood studios were initially hesitant to support Dolby SR-D. This was likely due to the fact that Dolby was already the dominant player in the surround sound market, and the studios did not want to give them too much power.
* **Timing:** Dolby SR-D was released in 1992, just as the home theater market was starting to take off. Consumers were more interested in purchasing home theater systems than in going to the movies.

### DTS (1993)

![](Jurassic_Park_DTS-3881470783.jpg)

{{% note %}}
**Why DTS was more successful than Dolby SR-D**

* **Affordability:** Exhibitors could purchase DTS's system for about $4,000, a mere fifth the cost of adopting Dolby's SR-D.
* **Support from Hollywood:** DTS already had the weight of an entire studio (Universal Pictures) and one of the most successful directors of all time (Steven Spielberg) behind it.

In contrast, Dolby SR-D was more expensive and did not have the support of a major Hollywood studio.

**Additional factors that may have contributed to the success of DTS:**

* **Effective marketing:** DTS marketed its system more effectively than Dolby marketed SR-D.
* **First-mover advantage:** DTS was the first digital surround sound system to be used in a major Hollywood film (Jurassic Park).

### History of home surround

- **late 1970s - early 1980s** - consumers create stereo system using existing music systems
- **1982** - Dolby Surround decoding
- **1987** - Dolby Pro Logic
- **Mid 1990s** - 5.1: DTS and Dolby Digital

{{% note %}}
**Bringing surround sound into the home**

* **1982:** Dolby introduced Dolby Surround decoding, which allowed consumers to watch their video cassettes in a simplified version (L/R/S) of Dolby Stereo. This was possible because film studios had been dumping their existing Dolby Stereo soundtracks into the two audio tracks available on hi-fi VHS and laserdisc. Dolby Surround offered the technology to decode these soundtracks, resulting in a significant improvement in sound quality for home viewers.
* **1987:** Dolby introduced Dolby Pro Logic, which added the center channel and steering effects of theatrical Dolby Stereo to the Dolby Surround format. This allowed home viewers to experience sound that was even closer to that of their local theater.
* **Early 1990s:** DTS and Dolby introduced home versions of their digital surround sound systems, DTS and Dolby Digital, respectively. These systems offered even better sound quality and more immersive soundstaging than previous surround sound formats.

**Differences between home and movie theater surround sound configurations:**

**Movie theaters:**

* The three front channels of a 5.1-channel configuration are spread behind the screen.
* An array of surround speakers is used, with multiple speakers placed along the side walls and back of the theater.

**Home theaters:**

* The left and right front speakers are generally placed some distance outside the width of the screen.
* Two point source surround speakers are used, one for each rear channel.

**Other differences:**

* Home theaters generally need to sound good only from a few listening positions, while for a large theater it is important to have acceptable sound from several hundred positions.
* Movie theaters need to have a wider range of “acceptable” seating than home theaters.

**Why do studios remix some or all of their films for DVD release?**

Studios remix some or all of their films for DVD release to account for the differences between home and movie theater surround sound configurations. For example, in a home theater setting, a sound originating from an onscreen source near the left edge of the frame may be perceived as coming from offscreen if it is mixed to the left front channel. To avoid this problem, studios may remix the sound to play from both the left and center front speakers.

Studios may also remix films for DVD release to improve the overall sound quality for home viewers. For example, studios may increase the volume of the surround channels or add new surround effects.

Overall, the goal of remixing films for DVD release is to create a more immersive and enjoyable listening experience for home viewers.
