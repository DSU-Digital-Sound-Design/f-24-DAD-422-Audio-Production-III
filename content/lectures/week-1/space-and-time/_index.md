## Introduction to Spatial Music

- Spatial music explores physical and perceived spaces in composition.
- Involves arrangement of performers and audience, and acoustic properties.
- Creates illusions of space within music.
- Explores historical and modern techniques.

{{% note %}}

- Spatial music is not just about pitch or rhythm; it's about how sound occupies space. 
- Composers like Stockhausen used physical space and performer placement to shape music experiences.
- The audience's experience can change based on their position within a performance space.
- The transition from acoustic to electronic spatialization opened new creative avenues for composers.

## General Classification of Spatial Designs

- Acoustic environments overview
- Sound-space types
- Categories of mobility
- Impact on listener perception

{{% note %}}

- Acoustic environments range from enclosed spaces like concert halls to open-air venues, each influencing sound differently.
- Sound-space can be categorized into real, virtual, or mixed, depending on whether the sounds are acoustic, electronic, or both.
- Mobility classifications include various combinations of static or mobile performers and audiences, affecting how performances are experienced.
- These parameters, such as reverberation time in enclosed spaces, significantly shape how listeners perceive and engage with musical space.

## Acoustic Environments

- Enclosed space examples
- Open-air space challenges
- Variable space dynamics
- Private, virtual listening spaces

{{% note %}}

- Enclosed spaces, like traditional concert halls, provide controlled acoustics and are ideal for certain musical genres.
- Open-air environments introduce challenges like variable acoustic backgrounds, impacting sound clarity and consistency.
- Variable spaces involve performances where the spatial arrangement can change, offering unique auditory experiences.
- Private, virtual spaces allow for personal listening, such as through headphones, creating intimate and immersive sound environments.

## Sound-Space Types

- Real sound-space characteristics
- Virtual sound-space elements
- Mixed sound-space integration
- Examples of sound-space usage

{{% note %}}

- Real sound-spaces are characterized by acoustic sounds produced by live instruments and voices in a physical environment.
- Virtual sound-spaces are created through electronic means, allowing for innovative soundscapes not limited by physical acoustics.
- Mixed sound-spaces blend acoustic and electronic sounds, creating a layered auditory experience.
- Examples include traditional orchestras for real sound-spaces, electronic music concerts for virtual, and multimedia performances for mixed sound-spaces.

## Categories of Mobility

- Static performers, static audience
- Mobile performers, static audience
- Static performers, mobile audience
- Mobile performers, mobile audience

{{% note %}}

- Static performers with a static audience is the most common setup, as seen in traditional concert settings.
- Mobile performers with a static audience, such as in processional music, engage the audience with movement and spatial dynamics.
- Static performers with a mobile audience allow listeners to experience the performance differently as they move through the space.
- Both mobile performers and audiences create a dynamic, interactive performance environment, often seen in experimental or site-specific works.

## Spatial Arrangements in Music

- **Point:** A soloist centrally located for an intimate focus.
- **Line Segment:** Performers arranged in a line, as in Ton de Leeuw’s *Car nos vignes sont en fleur*.
  - [Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1srKmyQDmEc).
- **Two Line Segments:** Two groups facing each other from a distance, as in Louis Andriessen’s *Hoketus*.
  - [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/uSIEEqXEIcA).
- **Triangle:** Three ensembles positioned to form a triangle, used in Stockhausen’s *Gruppen*.
  - [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/34_SfP7ZCXA).

{{% note %}}

- A point arrangement creates a central focus on a solo performer, offering an intimate musical experience.
- Line segments create a spatial dialogue between groups of performers, enhancing the sense of directionality in the music.
- Two line segments amplify the tension between opposing musical ideas or themes, as seen in *Hoketus*.
- A triangular setup, like in *Gruppen*, introduces a dynamic interplay between three distinct musical groups.

## More Spatial Arrangements

- **Square:** Four choirs positioned at the corners of a square, as in Stockhausen’s *Carré*.
- **Hexagon:** Six percussionists in a hexagon, as in Xenakis’s *Persephassa*.
  - [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/sTT3NmYdf60).
- **Circle:** Performers surrounding the audience in a circle, such as in Xenakis’s *Terretektorh* or Henry Brant’s *Orbits*.
  - [Watch *Orbits* here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/37ajOyhcl_c).
- **Sphere:** A spherical arrangement of sound sources surrounding the audience, envisioned by Stockhausen in *Spiral*.

{{% note %}}

- The square arrangement in *Carré* uses spatial separation to create an immersive choral experience.
- A hexagonal layout, as in *Persephassa*, allows sound to move fluidly around the audience, creating a sense of being enveloped by the music.
- Circular setups, like in *Terretektorh* and *Orbits*, place the audience at the center, making them feel as if the sound is coming from all directions.
- Spherical arrangements, while more conceptual, aim to fully immerse the listener in a 360-degree sound environment.

## Electronic Spatialization and Installations

- Electronic music expanded spatial possibilities with multi-channel setups.
- Stockhausen's *Kontakte* uses rotating speakers to create movement in sound.
  - [Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjKVJ2z66fk).
- Oliveros’s *Deep Listening* merges environmental acoustics with musical improvisation.
  - [Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoHuHBkT4es).
- Installations like *Dream House* and *Forty Part Motet* offer immersive sound environments.
  - [Watch *Dream House*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC6bhnu5Luc), [Watch *Forty Part Motet*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxIeulpigws).

{{% note %}}

- *Kontakte* places speakers in a square, making sound appear to move around the audience, exploring electronic spatialization.
- *Deep Listening* was recorded in a large cistern, utilizing the space’s natural reverb, and blending it with the music.
- The *Dream House* installation changes its sonic environment as the audience moves through it, offering a personalized auditory experience.
- *Forty Part Motet* allows listeners to walk among speakers, each playing an individual vocal line, creating a unique spatial experience.

## Audience as a Speaker Array

- The audience can actively participate in creating spatial music.
- *Dialtones: A Telesymphony* used mobile phones as part of the performance.
  - [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/039_0Olb1WQ).
- OK GO’s *Needing/Getting* turned a car into a spatial instrument.
  - [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yx_C94YSPUM).
- Modern performances utilize apps for audience interaction and spatial effects.

{{% note %}}

- *Dialtones: A Telesymphony* transformed mobile phones into a distributed speaker array, making the audience part of the performance.
- OK GO’s *Needing/Getting* involved a car playing an instrument, where driving through it created spatial sounds.
- Interactive apps, like in Dan Deacon’s concerts, sync sounds and lights among audience members for a collective experience.
- These methods turn passive listeners into active participants, enhancing the spatial dimension of the performance.
