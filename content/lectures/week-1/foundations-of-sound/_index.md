{{% note %}}
- In surround sound, especially with technologies like Dolby Atmos, understanding Physical Acoustics is essential for managing how sound waves interact with physical spaces and reach the listener.
- Physiological Acoustics is directly tied to how our ears and brain interpret these complex sound environments, affecting the placement and movement of sounds within a 3D space.

## Sound, Noise, and Music: Essential Definitions

- Sound: Vibrational energy perceived as auditory sensations.
- Noise: Unpleasant or unintended sound within a context.
- Music: Temporally organized sound and silence, communicating intention.
  - Music involves interaction among composer, performer, and listener.

{{% note %}}
- Understanding what constitutes sound, noise, and music is essential as we move into more complex audio environments where these elements intertwine.
- In immersive audio formats, distinguishing between desired sounds (music) and unwanted sounds (noise) is crucial for creating clear, engaging soundscapes.

## Music: A Temporal Art Form

- Music: Organized sound and silence, communicating without direct reference.
- Emphasis on temporal and communicative aspects.
- Interaction: Composer, performer, and listener shape the music experience.

{{% note %}}
- In immersive audio formats like Dolby Atmos, music is often treated as a dynamic, evolving soundscape rather than a static piece, enhancing the listener's engagement.
- The temporal and spatial organization of music in surround sound systems adds a new dimension to how music is experienced, making the interaction between composer, performer, and listener even more critical.
