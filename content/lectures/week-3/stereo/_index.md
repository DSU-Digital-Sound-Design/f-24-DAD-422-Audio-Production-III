# Stereo Reproduction and Microphone Techniques

{{% note %}} 
I'll cover the principles of conventional two-channel stereo related to loudspeaker and headphone reproduction.

### Two-Channel (2-0) Stereo

{{% note %}}
- Two-channel stereophonic reproduction (2-0 stereo) is the most common way of conveying spatial content.
- ‘Stereophony’ refers to any system that conveys 3D sound images.
- International terminology: ‘n-m stereo’ (n = front channels, m = rear/side channels in surround systems).

## Blumlein Stereo

{{% note %}}
- Optimal arrangement for stereo: equilateral triangle.
- Phantom image: creates the illusion of sound sources between the speakers.
- Listening position impacts image stability:
  - Too far forward: image too wide, hole in the center.
  - Too far back: image too narrow.
  - Off-center: image becomes asymmetrically balanced.

## Stereo Soundstage

{{% note %}}
- Stereo soundstage positions sound behind, between, and in front of the speakers.
- This effect is only perceptible in the sweet spot with loudspeakers, not with headphones.

## Summing Localization

![](summing-localization.png)

{{% note %}}
- Summing localization: illusion of phantom sources with similar ear signals.
- Phantom images can be created using only amplitude differences (<1 ms).
- Different for loudspeakers vs. headphones: loudspeakers create a smearing effect due to delay.
- Phantom center image is less focused than a real center speaker.

{{% note %}}
- Phantom image seeks to recreate the angle of a real source recorded with stereo techniques.

### Phantom and Discrete Images

- Discrete speaker images:
  - Clearer, more precise, timbrally assertive, smaller.
- Phantom images:
  - Larger, less focused, weaker sounding.

{{% note %}}
- Phantom images result from comb filtering and phase cancellation between speakers.
- Discrete speaker images occur with hard panning or center speaker use.
- Special panning circuits can extend phantom images slightly beyond speakers.
- Phantom images may have tonal coloration due to signal summing.

### Image Width

- Mono point-sources:
  - Centered, off-center, or to one side.
- Spread images:
  - Narrow or wide.
  - Symmetrically or asymmetrically panned.

{{% note %}}
- Mono sources create narrow, focused images.
- Spread images are produced by stereo mic arrays, synthesizers, and stereo effects.
- Spread images can vary in width and panning balance.

## Beyond the Loudspeakers

- Context: Stereo sources may appear super-wide based on surrounding content.
- Out-of-phase content: Decorrelation can make stereo sources appear wider than the speaker positions.

{{% note %}}
- Wide stereo sound sources with decorrelated information extend beyond speaker positions.
- Examples: synth pads, big room/hall reverbs.

## Depth Concepts

- High frequency attenuation
- Reverb
- Amplitude balance

{{% note %}}
- Depth (front-to-back) perspective:
  - **High frequency attenuation**: Distant sounds lose high frequencies.
  - **Reverb**: Closer sounds are dry, distant sounds are reverberant.
  - **Amplitude balance**: Quieter sounds can seem farther away.
- Bright, dry sounds may appear forward of the speakers.

## Static and Dynamic Panning

- Static: Panning that doesn’t change through the mix.
- Dynamic:
  - Fly-bys
  - Auto-panning
  - Ping-pong panning

{{% note %}}
- **Fly-bys**: Sounds move smoothly through the stereo image.
- **Auto-panning**: Automatically moves sound between left and right.
- **Ping-pong panning**: Bounces sounds between left and right.
- Dynamic panning enhances clarity and interest in a mix.

## Image Symmetry

- Balance guitar panned left with something else right.
- Panning percussion across the stereo field.

### Possible Stereo Image

{{% note %}}
- Use as much of the soundstage as possible to avoid holes in the mix.
