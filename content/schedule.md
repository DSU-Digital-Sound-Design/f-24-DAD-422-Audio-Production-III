## Friday

- In class - try to create a recording's perceived distance in a specific environment using reverb, volume, and filtering. Use the new field recording microphone. Use the iPhone measure app to measure distances. We could also try a familiar and unfamiliar sound.
  - Record something with the zoom at several distances
  - Record something in the studio at several distances
  - Try to artificially recreate the distance and spatial cues using the close-miced source and audio effects.
- Mono project check-in
